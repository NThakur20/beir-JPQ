We are excited to present our new model, JPQ. It almost matches the uncompressed Dense Retrieval counterpart with 30x compression on index size. The compressed index further brings 10x speedup on CPU and 2x speedup on GPU in query latency. 

The article has already been submitted to arxiv and is scheduled to be announced at Tue, 3 Aug 2021 00:00:00 GMT.

Code and trained models will be available soon.
