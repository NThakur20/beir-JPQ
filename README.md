# JPQ

* ðŸ”¥**News 2021-10: The extension of JPQ, [Learning Discrete Representations via Constrained Clustering for Effective and Efficient Dense Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05789) \[[code](https://github.com/jingtaozhan/RepCONC)\], was accepted by WSDM'22. It presents RepCONC and achieves state-of-the-art first-stage retrieval effectiveness-efficiency tradeoff. It utilizes constrained clustering to train discrete codes and then incorporates JPQ in the second-stage training.**

## Quick Tour 

JPQ greatly improves the efficiency of Dense Retrieval. It is able to compress the index size by 30x with negligible performance loss. It also provides 10x speedup on CPU and 2x speedup on GPU in query latency. 

Here is the effectiveness - index size (log-scale) tradeoff on MSMARCO Passage Ranking. **In contrast with trading index size for ranking performance, JPQ achieves high ranking effectiveness with a tiny index.**

Results at different trade-off settings are shown below.

JPQ is still very effective even if the compression ratio is over 100x and outperforms baselines at different compression ratio settings.

## Models and Indexes

You can download trained models and indexes from our [dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/miczl0zlj8vy47v/AAAwTNus2g6sABLB4dVH3Adba?dl=0). After open this link in your browser, you can see two folders, `doc` and `passage`. They correspond to MSMARCO passage ranking and document ranking. There are also two folders in either of them, `trained_models` and `indexes`. `trained_models` are the trained query encoders, and `indexes` are trained PQ indexes. Note, the `pid` in the index is actually the row number of a passage in the `collection.tsv` file instead of the official pid provided by MS MARCO. Different query encoders and indexes correspond to different compression ratios. For example, the query encoder named `m32.tar.gz` or the index named `OPQ32,IVF1,PQ32x8.index` means 32 bytes per doc, i.e., `768*4/32=96x` compression ratio.

You can easily download the files using [download_query_encoder.sh](./cmds/download_query_encoder.sh) and [download_index.sh](./cmds/download_index.sh). Just run:
```
sh ./cmds/download_query_encoder.sh
sh ./cmds/download_index.sh
```
## Ranking Results

We open-source the ranking results in our dropbox links: [passage rank link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/gv7vg1hwg1jv9s4/AAAU5v7JyVOtzDI-wuyvqEmKa?dl=0), [document rank link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/4xo226zy04fnisd/AAA_na4WtVV7eEf2-GFtgXm8a?dl=0).
`dev` folder and `test` folder correspond to MS MARCO development queries and TREC 2019 DL queries, respectively. 
In either folder, for each `m` value, we provide two ranking files corresponding to different text-id mapping. The one prefixed with 'official' means that it uses the official MS MARCO / TREC 2019 text-id mapping so you can directly use the official qrel files to evaulate the ranking. The other one uses the mapping generated by our [preprocessing](#preprocess) where we use line offset as id. Both files will give you the same metric number. The files are generated by [run_retrieve.sh](./cmds/run_retrieve.sh). Please see [retrieval section](#retrieval) to know about how to get those ranking results. 

## Requirements

This repo needs the following libraries (Python 3.x):
```
torch == 1.9.0
transformers == 4.3.3
faiss-gpu == 1.7.1
tensorboard==2.5.0
boto3
```

## Preprocess
Here are the commands for preprocessing/tokenization. 

If you do not have MS MARCO dataset, run the following command:
```
sh ./cmds/download_marco.sh
```
Preprocessing (tokenizing) only requires a simple command:
```
python preprocess.py --data_type 0; python preprocess.py --data_type 1
```
It will create two directories, i.e., `./data/passage/preprocess` and `./data/doc/preprocess`. We map the original qid/pid to new ids, the row numbers in the file. The mapping is saved to `pid2offset.pickle` and `qid2offset.pickle`, and new qrel files (`train/dev/test-qrel.tsv`) are generated. The passages and queries are tokenized and saved in the numpy memmap file. 

Note: JPQ, as long as our [SIGIR'21 models](https://github.com/jingtaozhan/DRhard), utilizes Transformers 2.x version to tokenize text. However, when Transformers library updates to 3.x or 4.x versions, the RobertaTokenizer behaves differently. 
To support REPRODUCIBILITY, we copy the RobertaTokenizer source codes from 2.x version to [star_tokenizer.py](https://github.com/jingtaozhan/JPQ/blob/main/star_tokenizer.py). During preprocessing, we use `from star_tokenizer import RobertaTokenizer` instead of `from transformers import RobertaTokenizer`. It is also **necessary** for you to do this if you use our JPQ model on other datasets. 

## Retrieval

This section shows how to retrieve candidates using our [open-sourced models and indexes](#models-and-indexes). 
Since we use [TREC_EVAL toolkit](https://trec.nist.gov/trec_eval/) for evaluation, please download it and compile:
```
sh ./cmds/download_trec_eval.sh
```

We show how to retrieve candidates and evaluate results in [run_retrieve.sh](cmds/run_retrieve.sh). Just run the command
```
sh cmds/run_retrieve.sh
```
Then you are expected to get the results reported in our paper. 

In [run_retrieve.sh](cmds/run_retrieve.sh), it calls [run_retrieval.py](./run_retrieval.py). 
Arguments for this evaluation script are as follows,
* `--preprocess_dir`: preprocess dir
    * `./data/passage/preprocess`: default dir for passage preprocessing.
    * `./data/doc/preprocess`: default dir for document preprocessing.
* `--mode`: Evaluation mode
    * `dev` run retrieval for msmarco development queries.
    * `test`: run retrieval for TREC 2019 DL Track queries.
* `--index_path`: Index path.
* `--query_encoder_dir`:  Query encoder dir, which involves `config.json` and `pytorch_model.bin`.
* `--output_path`:  Output ranking file path, formatted following msmarco guideline (qid\tpid\trank) for dev set or TREC guideline for test set.
* `--max_query_length`: Max query length, default: 32.
* `--batch_size`: Encoding and retrieval batch size at each iteration.
* `--topk`: Retrieve topk passages/documents.
* `--gpu_search`: Whether to use gpu for embedding search.

## Training

JPQ is initialized by [STAR](https://github.com/jingtaozhan/DRhard). STAR trained on passage ranking is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bJw8P15cFiV239mTgFQxVilXMWqzqXUU?usp=sharing). STAR trained on document ranking is available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18GrqZxeiYFxeMfSs97UxkVHwIhZPVXTc?usp=sharing). 

First, use STAR to encode the corpus and run OPQ to initialize the index. For example, on document ranking task, please run:
```bash
python ./run_init.py \
  --preprocess_dir ./data/doc/preprocess/ \
  --model_dir ./data/doc/star \
  --max_doc_length 512 \
  --output_dir ./data/doc/init \
  --subvector_num 96
```
On passage ranking task, you can set the `max_doc_length` to 256 for faster inference. 

Now you can train the query encoder and PQ index. For example, on document ranking task, the command is 
```bash
python run_train.py \
    --preprocess_dir ./data/doc/preprocess \
    --model_save_dir ./data/doc/train/m96/models \
    --log_dir ./data/doc/train/m96/log \
    --init_index_path ./data/doc/init/OPQ96,IVF1,PQ96x8.index \
    --init_model_path ./data/doc/star \
    --lambda_cut 10 \
    --centroid_lr 1e-4 \
    --train_batch_size 32
```
`--gpu_search` is optional for fast gpu search during training. `lambda_cut` should be set to 200 for passage ranking task. `centroid_lr` is different for different compression ratios. 
Let M be the number of subvectors. `centroid_lr` equals to 5e-6 for  `M = 16/24`, 2eâˆ’5 for `M = 32`, and 1eâˆ’4 for `M = 48/64/96`. The number of training epochs is set to 6. In fact, the performance is already quite satisfying after 1 or 2 epochs. Each epoch costs less than 2 hours on our machine.
